**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT! PLEASE, KEEP THIS IN MIND**

**Furthermore, the OO on this project is crap but I was testing several ways.
Must be fixed in the future!**

What is this?
-------------

This project tries to be another client for mongo, but this time written in
GTK 3.

Dependencies
------------

- pymongo

Screenshots
-----------

Please, take a look to the dev screens, if you have any idea how to show
better the results, share it with me!

I though about use something like a spreadsheet to show the results, but
the embeded documents make this task very difficult.
